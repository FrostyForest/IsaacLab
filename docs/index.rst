Overview
========

**Isaac Orbit** (or *orbit* in short) is a unified and modular framework, built on top of `NVIDIA
Omniverse <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/>`__ and `Isaac
Sim <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html>`__,
for robot learning. It offers a modular design to easily and efficiently
create robot learning environments with photo-realistic scenes, and fast
and efficient simulation.
