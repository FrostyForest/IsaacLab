Overview
========

**Orbit** is a unified and modular framework for robot learning that aims to simplify common workflows
in robotics research (such as RL, learning from demonstrations, and motion planning). It is built upon
`NVIDIA Isaac Sim` to leverage the latest simulation capabilities for photo-realistic scenes, and fast
and efficient simulation. The core objectives of the framework are:

- **Modularity**: Easily customize and add new environments, robots, and sensors.
- **Agility**: Adapt to the changing needs of the community.
- **Openness**: Remain open-sourced to allow the community to contribute and extend the framework.
- **Battery-included**: Include a number of environments, sensors, and tasks that are ready to use.

For more information about the framework, please refer to the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04195>`_
:cite:`mittal2023orbit`. For clarifications on NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, please check out the
