Interacting with Assets
=======================

Having spawned objects in the scene, these tutorials show you how to create physics handles for these
objects and interact with them. These revolve around the :class:`~omni.isaac.lab.assets.AssetBase`
class and its derivatives such as :class:`~omni.isaac.lab.assets.RigidObject`,
:class:`~omni.isaac.lab.assets.Articulation` and :class:`~omni.isaac.lab.assets.DeformableObject`.
