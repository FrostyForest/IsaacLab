This sub-module introduces the managers for handling various aspects of the environment.

The managers are used to handle various aspects of the environment such as randomization, curriculum, and
observations. Each manager implements a specific functionality for the environment. The managers are
designed to be modular and can be easily extended to support new functionality.

Each manager is implemented as a class that inherits from the :class:`ManagerBase` class. Each manager
class should also have a corresponding configuration class that defines the configuration terms for the
manager. Each term should the :class:`ManagerBaseTermCfg` class or its subclass.

Example pseudo-code for a manager:

    .. code-block:: python

        from omni.isaac.orbit.utils import configclass
        from omni.isaac.orbit.utils.mdp import ManagerBase, ManagerBaseTermCfg

        @configclass
        class MyManagerCfg:

            my_term_1: ManagerBaseTermCfg = ManagerBaseTermCfg(...)
            my_term_2: ManagerBaseTermCfg = ManagerBaseTermCfg(...)
            my_term_3: ManagerBaseTermCfg = ManagerBaseTermCfg(...)

        # define manager instance
        my_manager = ManagerBase(cfg=ManagerCfg(), env=env)
