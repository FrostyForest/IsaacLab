"""
This subpackage contains the sensor classes that are compatible with the Isaac Sim. We include both
USD-based and custom sensors. The USD-based sensors are the ones that are available in Omniverse and
require creating a USD prim for them. Custom sensors, on the other hand, are the ones that are
implemented in Python and do not require creating a USD prim for them.
