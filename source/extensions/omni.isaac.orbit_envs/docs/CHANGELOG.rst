0.2.3 (2023-03-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Tuned the observations and rewards for ``Isaac-Lift-Franka-v0`` environment.

0.2.2 (2023-03-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed the issue with rigid object not working in the ``Isaac-Lift-Franka-v0`` environment.

0.2.1 (2023-03-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Added a flag ``disable_contact_processing`` to the :class:`SimCfg` class to handle
  contact processing effectively when using TensorAPIs for contact reporting.
* Added verbosity flag to :meth:`export_policy_as_onnx` to print model summary.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Clarified the documentation of flags in the :class:`SimCfg` class.
* Added enabling of ``omni.kit.viewport`` and ``omni.replicator.isaac`` extensions
  dynamically to maintain order in the startup of extensions.
* Corrected the experiment names in the configuration files for training environments with ``rsl_rl``.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Changed the default value of ``enable_scene_query_support`` in :class:`SimCfg` class to False.
  The flag is overridden to True inside :class:`IsaacEnv` class when running the simulation in
  non-headless mode.

0.2.0 (2023-01-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Added environment wrapper and sequential trainer for the skrl RL library
* Added training/evaluation configuration files for the skrl RL library

0.1.2 (2023-01-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Added the flag ``replicate_physics`` to the :class:`SimCfg` class.
* Increased the default value of ``gpu_found_lost_pairs_capacity`` in :class:`PhysxCfg` class

0.1.1 (2023-01-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug in ``Isaac-Velocity-Anymal-C-v0`` where the domain randomization is
  not applicable if cloning the environments with ``replicate_physics=True``.
