**Orbit** is a unified and modular framework for robot learning that aims to simplify common workflows
in robotics research (such as RL, learning from demonstrations, and motion planning). It is built upon
[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) to leverage the latest
simulation capabilities for photo-realistic scenes and fast and accurate simulation.

Please refer to our [documentation page](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/orbit) to learn more about the
installation steps, features, and tutorials.

## ðŸŽ‰ Announcement (22.12.2023)

We're excited to announce merging of our latest development branch into the main branch! This update introduces
several improvements and fixes to enhance the modularity and user-friendliness of the framework. We have added
several new environments, especially for legged locomotion, and are in the process of adding new environments.

Feel free to explore the latest changes and updates. We appreciate your ongoing support and contributions!
